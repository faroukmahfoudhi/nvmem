1) This is a Basic non-volatile memory storage component with a unitary test.

2) Package content:

   - gpNvm.c: Source file of the non-volatile memory storage component API. 
              A description about the solution and an explanation about each API is provided in this file.
              Corruption detection is implemented but storage recovery is not.

   - gpNvm.h: Header file of the non-volatile memory storage component API.

   - unitary_test.c: A demo program unitary testing this component and showing how to use the API.

   - Makefile: Makefile to build the file and generate the unitary test executable

   - ReadMe: This read me.
